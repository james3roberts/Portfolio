# Portfolio
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This Project was to create code that would gather the information from one file, make conversions and place the updated information into another file. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I belive I used a small amout of code to make the porject work. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  To enhance this code it would need to have more option on what needed to be compleated. Nothing about this code is secure so there are lots of things that I am sure
  I could do to help with this aspect. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  For this project learning how to find, open, and create a new file were the fun challeng. To overcome this I just read some of the fstream docs and it became quite clear
  this would be simpler than it sounded.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think the biggest skill from this project is the ability to work with files from a program that I build. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  With the inline comments this porgram will need little effort to maintain, it is easy to read, and can be adapated to anything that may need something similer. 
  
  READ ME FOR WEEK7 CS230:
  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? This is an android game that will be turned into a web based game that shows blurred images that clear over thirty seconds. The team then guesses the images and scores points. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?Researching was my strong point. I am good at digging to find answers that I do not have. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? The design document was really helpful when trying to fill in the missing information. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would like to revise the design constraints. I think with more time and research I could go into much more detail
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? When I was interpreting the needs of the client I was thinking of the end result and how both would work together. This helped keep me focused on the actual needs.I feel that It is important to keep the clients' needs at the forefront because they are the ones paying for the end product.  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I started at the beginning of the design document and worked my way to the end. I think if i was to do it again I would start with my recommendations. This will have given me the chance to do research on every area and be more familiar with it.
