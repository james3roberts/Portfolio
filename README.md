Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This Project was to create code that would gather the information from one file, make conversions and place the updated information into another file. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I belive I used a small amout of code to make the porject work. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  To enhance this code it would need to have more option on what needed to be compleated. Nothing about this code is secure so there are lots of things that I am sure
  I could do to help with this aspect. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  For this project learning how to find, open, and create a new file were the fun challeng. To overcome this I just read some of the fstream docs and it became quite clear
  this would be simpler than it sounded.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think the biggest skill from this project is the ability to work with files from a program that I build. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  With the inline comments this porgram will need little effort to maintain, it is easy to read, and can be adapated to anything that may need something similer.
